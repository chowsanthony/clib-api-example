Example use of CDISC Library APIs

`ig-metadata-columnar` demonstrates how to use the CDISC Library API client available in PyPI to retrieve an SDTM or SEND Implementation Guide (IG) and reconstruct the metadata into a familiar columnar format, similar to the specification tables found in their PDF files.

`bc-sdtm-relationship` is a simple and fun game where you guess how a variable relates to another in a CDISC Biomedical Concept (BC). An SDTM Dataset Specialization is one way to implement a BC, using predefined variables and controlled terms. Within an SDTM Dataset Specialization, variables have specific relationships that define their roles.
