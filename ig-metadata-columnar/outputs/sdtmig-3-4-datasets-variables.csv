When the test is for a sublineage which can only be identified by specifying additional markers (i.e., has not been given a name) or which is further restricted to a subpopulation based on a particular cell state (e.g., activated, proliferating, apoptotic), the Sublineage Marker String (CPSBMRKS), Cell State (CPCELSTA), and Cell State Marker String (CPCSMRKS) variables are additionally populated and the value in CPTEST is suffixed with ""Sub"" to denote that it is a subset of the population identified in CPTEST (e.g., Monocytes Sub). \n The value in CPTEST cannot be longer than 40 characters.",Req

Whereas the entire monocyte cell population can be defined as CD14+ cells, the additional CCR2 and CD16 markers are used to differentiate one sublineage from another. As none of these sublineages have been given names, they are only known by the CCR2 and CD16 marker combinations. By associating the CPTEST value of ""Monocytes Sub"" with, for example, a value of ""CCR2+CD16-"" in CPSBMRKS, the full test is defined to be the CCR2+CD16- monocyte subpopulation.",Perm

Findings,CP,14,CPCSMRKS,Cell State Marker String,Char,,,,Variable Qualifier,"Identifies the marker(s) or indicator(s) used to define the cell state (i.e., the value in CPCELSTA). \n For example, when Ki67 expression is used to determine that a cell population is in a proliferating state (i.e., CPCELSTA value=""PROLIFERATING""), the value ""Ki67+"" in CPCSMRKS indicates that positive expression of Ki67 was used to define the population as proliferating. Similarly, a value of ""Ki67-"" in CPCSMRKS would indicate that lack of expression of Ki67 defined the ""NON-PROLIFERATING"" cell state in CPCELSTA. The CPCSMRKS value is useful for quickly determining which marker(s) were used to classify (i.e., operationally define) a cell population based on a functional/biological state.",Perm

To ensure nuances important for accurately interpreting the data are accounted for and which arise from the use of different gating strategies, it is often necessary to qualify the test in terms of the gating strategy. For some purposes, however, and at the discretion of the sponsor, only the ultimate or penultimate gate is identified.
